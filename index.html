        <p>Hello, I'm Mark Tusubira, a 30-year-old restaurant manager with a passion for software development. I was
            born and
            raised in Jinja, Uganda, often known as 'the Pearl of Africa.' I'm currently studying for a Bachelor of
            Science in
            Applied Software Development at BYU-Idaho through BYU-Pathway Worldwide. When I'm not managing my
            restaurant, I love to
            cook, listen to music, and attend church.</p>
